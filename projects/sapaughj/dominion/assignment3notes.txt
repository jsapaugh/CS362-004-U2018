@ohdiana Did you figure it out? The bonus is used to account for coins gotten when you play action cards during your turn. updateCoins only counts coppers, silvers, and golds.

ohdiana [12:43 PM]
yup yup
thanks!!

ohdiana [5:31 PM]
anyone working on the card stuff?

diana [5:36 PM]
I'm still trying to figure out unit tests.

ohdiana [5:36 PM]
hello fellow diana!!

diana [6:03 PM]
@ohdiana We're given several test examples:  supplyTest.c, testBuyCard.c, testDrawCard.c, testShuffle.c.  Is there any reason not to start with those for our unit tests?


ohdiana [6:12 PM]
i think you can use those as an example and build from them if you want. i used updateCoin as my base template and went from there
i think overall the unit tests structure would be good if they resembled theupdateCoin one

diana [6:14 PM]
Yes, I agree.  Did you actually use updateCoin as one of the unit tests or pick 4 others?
I won't ask you which ones.

ohdiana [6:14 PM]
i used updateCoin
and three others
i didnt copy the update coins template exactly though like the way the ran the same test for differnet player- it houghts that was a lot

diana [6:16 PM]
Makes sense.

hola
how do we test to see that a player's coin amount go up or down. i see just one coin variable in the game struct and it seems to be the collective number of coins (edited)

diana [10:45 PM]
Seems like you'd have to look through their hand and count up the value of any treasure cards.

ohdiana [10:46 PM]
ahhh
good call
thank you.. Diana!!
haha it's so fun to say our shared name

diana [11:08 PM]
LOL, no problem Diana

So I'm a bit confused. It says to base everything off of assignment 2, but that would mean creating a branch off assignment-2 branch, right? Or are we supposed to merge our assignment-2 branch then branch assignment-3?

schallhh [11:15 AM]
either works
I've been merging mine into master so everything stays a bit neater
but that is not necessary, as long as the code you start assignmnet 3 with is the code from 2

matthewshim [12:28 PM]
@rymur yes
in general you branch off of the existing branch
if the new branch/feature you're adding is an extension from the one prior
however someone else managing the repo may very well merge branch-1 to master
etc
but, let's say they've merged branch-assignment-1 to master
and you're checking out branch-assignment-3
or beyond
it's sort of on you to make sure to check if master is actually in sync with the branch you are working off of
i.e say branch-2 isn't merged yet
and you checkout master
it'll reset to branch-1's "stuff" for your branch 3

rymur [12:36 PM]
Yeah, I'm just wondering if we're supposed to ever change master for this class or keep it the way we found it. I'd prefer to merge to master and rebranch to avoid a long chain of branches.

matthewshim [12:36 PM]
yeah that's a good question, I'm thinking we might at the end?
it makes sense from the "well if they screw something up they can just get the prior branch" instead of starting over, but that part hasn't really been taught

diana [2:12 PM]
I merged branch2 to master and then created branch3 off of that.  I can always go back to an earlier version of master if I need a clean copy.

How hard is this assignment? I haven’t started it yet

schallhh [2:46 PM]
You should start
It's just time consuming.
You'll be fine. But you shouldn't leave this one till the last minute.

kyle.martinez [3:43 PM]
Can someone give me a sanity check for gcov on assignment 3? When I run gcov, I should be looking for what lines/statements/branches in dominion.c my tests actually run? Not the lines in my tests that execute, right? (edited)

diana [4:31 PM]
That’s how I interpreted it
Based on the bst example we were given (edited)
You mean assignment 3 though right?

kyle.martinez [4:34 PM]
Thanks, there was a post on piazza that confused me. But I don't think it makes sense the other way around so I'm going to assume it has to be on dominion.c
Yes, woops.

diana [4:35 PM]
I agree that the instructor’s answer was really confusing (edited)
